Midterm-Data-Project
====================

Where you should live, based on how lazy you are.

by Rafael Mkrtchyan and Nick Rose

This python program uses data from a short quiz and from the CDC to match you with list of 5 states 
in the US where you might like to live. Where you are placed is based on how lazy you are, and how 
lazy these states are. 

CDC link: http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/PASurveillance/StateSumResultV.asp?CI=&Year=2001&State=0#data
look to last column for relevant data

future work: implementing this script in a Webpage built with HTML/CSS.

Note: This is our first hackathon. We are freshman in CS10-Beauty and Joy of Computing.

Special thanks to TA Samir Makhani for giving us a crash course in python and terminal before the hackathon!
